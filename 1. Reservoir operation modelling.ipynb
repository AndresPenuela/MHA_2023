Notice that the function $max(0,...)$ enables us to only count the difference between `demand` and `supply` when this is positive, that is, when the `supply` is smaller than the `demand`, and a water shortage is indeed produced. Also, the squaring is a 'mathematical trick' to make sure that larger deficit amounts are given more weight than smaller ones. This translates the fact that small deficit amounts are easier to mitigate and hence more acceptable, while larger ones can cause disproportionately severe impacts and should be avoided as much as possible."

For example if we fully cover the demand for the first 7 weeks, we drawdown the reservoir to a point that we are forced to dramatically reduce the release in the last week, causing a very severe deficit. A more effective approach is to cause smaller deficits across all time steps, that is, tolerate some small deficits even when in principle we may fully cover the demand, in order to prevent more severe deficits in the later period. This type of approach is called ***hedging*** (see for example [You and Cai 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006WR005481)).\n",
